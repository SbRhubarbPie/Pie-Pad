  Instructions for the hackpad coding is very unclear for qmk, I spent 4 hours downloading it because of my terrible internet while being confused reading documentation.

  I gave up on qmk am now looking into kmk

  figured out kmk, it was much easier, I did the software for the keys and cadded the PCB with attached modules.

  Tomorrow I think I will swap out my LEDs for a rotary encoder (I didn't even CAD them because I am swapping them out)
